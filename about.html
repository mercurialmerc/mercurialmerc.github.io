                    <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
                    <p>This is my final project for the Spring 2025 cohort of the <a href="https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/governance/">BlueDot AI Governance course</a>. I've created a standardized template  (Template to communicate Research Insights to Policymakers - TRIP) that aims to bridge the gap between technical AI research and policymakers, intended for use by
                        research communicators to translate complex technical papers into accessible summaries that highlight the policy implications.</p>
                    
                    <p>By providing a consistent structure for communicating research insights, this project hopes to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make technical AI research more accessible to non-technical policymakers</li>
                        <li>Establish a common understanding of technical AI research, useful for discussing AI in policy contexts</li>
                        <li>Enable stakeholders to make more informed governnace decisions based on relevant technical research</li>
                    </ul>

                    This project represents my personal academic work as part of the BlueDot AI Governance course and does not reflect the views or positions of my employer.

                    <h2>How to use this Resource</h2>
                    <p>The <a href="index.html">template</a> provides a structure for summarizing technical AI papers in an accessible way. It begins with necessary metadata (the "SAND") and tags (that could be implemented to 
                        link to other papers in the same domain or subdomain) and an estimation of how much technical expertise the reader might require to read the paper itself. </p>
                    
                    <p>The  "GIST" section provides a 
                    very brief overview of the papers' main thesis or contents, along with a few example policy considerations. These are not intended to be exhaustive, but provide some xcontext for what questions
                might be relevant to ask.</p>
                
                <p>The next section the "WAVE" contains a more detailed summary of the paper, keeping the technical level as accessible as possible while not losingany crucial details. Important, 
            more technical terms are clickable, and a pop-up appears with a definition or context - intended to have just enough depth for the reader to be able to follow. The stakeholder sections gives some insight into 
            who might find this research especially relevant. </p>            
            <p>Finally, there is a section for additional resources ("DIVING DEEP"),
        which is intended to house explainers, opinion pieces on this particular research or related concepts, as well as any other  relevent material. </p>
